# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-Accident-Control-System
The number of fatal road accidents are increasing day by day and has been a great challenge 
put in front of public health and the front page is road accident. The most prominent death of 
today's population is because of road accidents. The count of people died in accident is more 
than the number of soldiers who sacrifice their lives in battlefield. Apart from this driver's 
drowsiness lack of road sense of drivers, because of rash driving, drunken and other reasons. 
Our project idea "Drowsiness Detection alarm and Accident Control System" is solution on all 
this problem and our project moto is controlling accident. The main concept of our project is if 
driver is feeling sleepy, tired or lazy or by mistake his/her eyes are getting close then driver get 
one warning alarm and if driver get one warning alarm and if driver doesn't response within 10 
sec the one more alarm is given. So, in this way our software can control accident and saves 
many life
